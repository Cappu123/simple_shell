# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

By: Julien Barbier
Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: Cappy Alemayehu)

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:


* [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64)
* [Approaching a Project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/350)


## Backgound Context

Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone,] (https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/)***without the help of Google:***

### General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of <code>main</code>
* How does the shell use the <code>PATH</code> to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the <code>execve</code> system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is <code>EOF</code> / “end-of-file”?

## Requirements

### General
* Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>,<code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using <code>gcc</code>, using the options <code>-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</code>
* All your files should end with a new line
* A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the <code>Betty</code> style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl] (https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl] (https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to [(why?)] (https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems)
* Write a <code>README</code> with the description of your project
* You should have an <code>AUTHORS</code> file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker

### GitHub
*There should be one project repository per group. If you and your partner have a repository with the same name in both your accounts, you risk a 0% score. Add your partner as a collaborator. *
